## Backend Setup (Date: 22 Feb 2026)

- Confirmed API root endpoint is working at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

 (Date: 25 Feb 2026) — JWT Authentication & Protected Routes Integration
✅ What I Did

Integrated JWT authentication using Django REST Framework SimpleJWT.

Configured login endpoint to generate access and refresh tokens.

Implemented protected API route using IsAuthenticated permission class.

Tested authentication flow using Thunder Client.

Added Authorization header (Bearer <access_token>) to access protected endpoints.

Debugged server error caused by incorrect user field reference (username vs custom user model).

🧠 Why I Did It

To secure backend API endpoints.

To ensure only authenticated users can access protected resources.

To simulate real-world production backend authentication flow.

To understand how JWT tokens are issued, validated, and attached to requests.
